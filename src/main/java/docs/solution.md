## ðŸ§± Assumptions

- All nodes are reachable through the edges.
- No concurrency issues (sequential simulation).
- Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is used to plan shortest paths (in seconds).
- Only one package is considered for simplicity; expandability for multiple packages is planned.

## Breakdown

- Each class represents a specific entity in the problem domain. (Node, Edge, Train, Package). This helps to segregate responsibilities and makes the code more maintainable.
- Each node needs to be reachable via undirected edges.
- Input is taken in as minutes and converted to seconds for processing.
- `moveTrain()` method simulates the train's journey, updating its position and handling package loading/unloading.
- The method supports finding the shortest path using Dijkstra's algorithm when the package is 2 stations away.
- The application runs in the psvm main method
